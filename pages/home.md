# Ember JSON API Resources

An [Ember CLI] Addonâ€¦ a lightweight solution for data persistence in an [Ember.js]
application following the [JSON API] 1.0 specification (your anti-bikeshedding
weapon for API development).

URLs are first class in the JSON API 1.0 specification and first class
in the [Ember.js] Router. Why not make them first class in your persistence
solution too? Now you can with the [ember-jsonapi-resources] addon.

This addon was inspired by finding a simple path to shipping an application
implementing the JSON API spec by using the [JSONAPI::Resources] gem to production.

Whether you adopt the JSON API 1.0 spec or not, this addon is a template for
creating a data persistence solution for your [Ember.js] application that models
the domain of your API server. The addon code is rather concise; borrow at will.
